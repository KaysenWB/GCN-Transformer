# GCN-Transformer
Implementation and performance comparison of several common deep learning networks for ship trajectory prediction, including LSTM, GRU, Seq2Seq, TCN, Transformer, and a hybrid network GCN- Transformer. The input data are processed AIS data containing trajectory information and adjacency matrix, processed with reference to https://github.com/KaysenWB/AIS-Process.git.

This is the implementation code for the following paper: A Hybrid Method for Multi-Ship Trajectory Prediction with Graph Convolutional Network and Transformer.

# SS-GLMP

This is the implementation code for the paper "Enhancing navigation safety for MASS: A Graph-based learning model for motion perception in multi-ship encounters".

Implementation and performance comparison of several common deep learning networks for ship trajectory prediction, including LSTM, GRU, Seq2Seq, TCN, Transformer, and our network GLMP. The input data are processed AIS data containing trajectory information and adjacency matrix, processed with reference to https://github.com/KaysenWB/AIS-Process.git.
